<h1><b>🚪 Embedded ERS Door Opener Driver (C)</b></h1>

<h3><b>📖 Overview</b></h3>
<p>This project provides an embedded <b>C</b> driver for controlling a door opener system, which operates via a button press to open or close the door. It is perfect for DIY safes or similar applications. The driver interfaces with hardware components such as motors and buttons for manual control, ensuring reliable and efficient door operation.</p>

<h3><b>✨ Features</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Control and automation of electronic door opener systems.</li>
  <li>Written in <b>C</b> for low-level embedded hardware interaction.</li>
  <li>Reliable communication with hardware interfaces and efficient real-time performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>⚙️ Prerequisites</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>C Compiler</b>: A C compiler (Code Composer Studio) for compiling the source code.</li>
  <li><b>Embedded hardware platform</b>: The project uses the MSP430FR2355 microcontroller for deploying and testing the driver, but other similar hardware platforms (e.g., STM32, Arduino) can also be used.</li>
  <li><b>Required libraries</b>: Any necessary libraries for communication with specific hardware components (e.g., GPIO, I2C, SPI).</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>🔧 Installation</b></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Clone this repository to your local machine:
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/MasterMar11/embedded_ers_door_opener_drv.git</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to the project directory:
    <pre><code>cd Embedded_ers_door_opener_drv</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Upload the compiled driver to your embedded system.</li>
</ol>

<h3><b>💻 Usage</b></h3>
<p>After installation and setup, the driver can be used to control the door opener hardware. For further configuration, hardware setup, and specific instructions on interfacing with the door opener, refer to the source code and comments.</p>
